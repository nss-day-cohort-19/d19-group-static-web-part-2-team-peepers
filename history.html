                    <p>Liquid Gold is a company started by US to promote flavor and color over the current health and whole food trends sweeping the nation.<br><br>Who needs leafy greens and simple ingredient lists? <strong>Rhetorical question!</strong><br><br>
                    Our products provide you with that <strong>WOW!</strong> factor and a taste that can't be reproduced by anyone or anything else. We can't even guarantee that our flavors will match batch to batch. With a minimum of 1000 ingredients per drink, (excluding our new &copy'Water') we know you'll always be wondering 'What's that flavor?', but that is a question better suited for our flavanoid scientists. </p>
